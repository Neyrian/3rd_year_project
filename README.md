# 3rd year SOFTWARE PROJECT at Polytech' Grenoble

During the 3rd year in computer science at Polytech Grenoble, FRANCE, we had to develop a 2D video game using JAVA in one month. This project consisted in creating a game engine based on automata.

With my project team, we developed Kusinta. This game is a "rogue-like platformer" where the player explore a randomly generated dungeon, looting money and increase its power, until fighting final boss.
